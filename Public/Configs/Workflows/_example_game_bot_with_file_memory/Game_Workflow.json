Detailed information about the game can be found below:\n\n<game_instructions>\n{chat_system_prompt}\n</game_instructions>\n\nPlease carefully analyze the latest messages that have come in, to determine exactly what the user is saying or doing. Please pay special attention to any OOC messages. OOC stands for Out of Character, and refers to one gamer speaking directly to another outside the context of their characters. For example, if a human player controls an Orc character, and an AI controls an Elf character, then an OOC message like `(OOC: I think that Elves should be a little more dignified)` is not spoken by the Orc to the Elf, but rather from one player to another — it has no effect on the story.\n\nIMPORTANT: OOC messages are NOT system messages; they are distinct and separate. They represent direct communication between players.",
    "prompt": "Please consider the last twenty messages in the game:\n\n<game_session>\n{chat_user_prompt_last_twenty}\n</game_session>\n\nIn complete sentences, please respond to the following items:\n\nA) Does the latest message contain only in-game content, or was there an OOC message included?\nB) What exactly occurred in the recent messages? If in-game, describe clearly what took place and the meaning of any dialogue. If an OOC message was included, break down what the player meant and what they expect.\nC) Please challenge your answer to B. Is there any chance you misunderstood? Justify why or why not.\nD) Should the upcoming response include an OOC message to the other player? Appropriate times include:\n    - If you are unclear about something in the current game, it is acceptable to use OOC to clarify\n    - If the user sent an OOC message, responding in kind is appropriate\n    - Only if you have something new or novel to add; avoid repeating previous OOC points\n\nPlease follow all of the above instructions now.",

OOC (Out of Character) are direct player-to-player communications, separate from character actions or dialogue. They do not affect the game world directly but help coordinate expectations and improve gameplay. For example, if a human player controls an Orc character, and an AI controls an Elf character, then an OOC message like `(OOC: I think that Elves should be a little more dignified)` is not spoken by the Orc to the Elf, but rather from one player to another — it has no effect on the story.",
    "prompt": "A new message has come in during an ongoing game session. As the session continues, you maintain a rolling summary of key events, stored as 'memory' chunks.

Do you have suggestions to improve the experience for both players?\n\nB) Draft the next in-game response. Keep it engaging, concise (ideally 2 paragraphs or less), and consistent with the established narrative. If needed, include an OOC message to the other player to clarify intent or suggest adjustments. Only include OOC if you’re responding to one or have something new to contribute — avoid repetition.\n\nC) Review the proposed response for factual accuracy against the memories and messages. Confirm details like item possession, locations, character traits, and prior events. Be critical — first drafts often contain inconsistencies.\n\nD) Critically assess the response for:\n- Logical coherence: Does the emotional tone match the context?\n- Repetition: Are descriptions, phrases, or reactions reused unnecessarily?\n- Overly positive reactions: Is the character responding happily to something that should provoke concern or hesitation?\n- Character consistency: Is the behavior aligned with the character’s known personality and development?\n\nE) Based on this review, confirm whether any revisions are needed to ensure realism and engagement.\n\nF) Under the heading '# Final Proposed Response', write the complete, corrected response.\n\nPlease follow these instructions now.",
