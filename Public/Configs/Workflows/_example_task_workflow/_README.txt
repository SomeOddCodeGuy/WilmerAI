This is for Open WebUI. Your main workflow may be many steps, and Open WebUI has multiple tasks that it assigns the
LLM after your prompt goes through; things like generating titles and tags. If you go to connections in Open WebUI's admin
settings and add this user, then go to models and click this user and set it to public, and then go to Interface and
select the two dropdowns for the task model- you can set this for tasks. Its small, quick, and simple. Now all the little
interface tasks will be handled by this and NOT by your complex workflows.
