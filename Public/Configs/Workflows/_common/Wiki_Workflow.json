This is the first of the four, meaning that the research can be further expanded upon the results of this query. As such, this search topic should focus on broad knowledge which can be narrowed down in future steps\n- The search mechanism for the wikipedia article is powered by a small language model, similar to BERT or e5-base. As such, complex queries will generally return bad results. In order to maximize the research value, unique, short and very specific queries need to written\n- The research is constrained only to Wikipedia, so encyclopedic knowledge will be the primary corpus of data available.\n\n### The Task ###\nGiven this information, please respond to the following in complete sentences.\nA) Given the topic and the rules, what information are you hoping to attain from this research round's wikipedia article?\nB) Given the constraints of the model that the wikipedia search uses, what very simple and short query should be utilized with the goal of finding the information you desire? Generate the most canonical, neutral, and likely-to-succeed broad topic search query for this topic. Do not include years, rankings, or adjectives.\n\nExample:\n- For the research topic of 'top MMORPGs in 2024', you would choose 'MMORPG'.\n- For the research topic of 'best sci-fi movies ever', you would choose 'Science fiction film'.",
