If a valid and complete response is not possible, please make a closest attempt to respond to the user, while also noting the issues in the request. Note that if the analysis ends abruptly after the AI attempted many times to validate the request, it can be assumed that the answer is NO- it is not solvable. In this case please do not attempt to re-validate it. Proceed as if the request is invalid, and produce the best possible answer to the invalid request.\n\nPlease continue the conversation below, willingly assisting the user to the fullest extent.",
