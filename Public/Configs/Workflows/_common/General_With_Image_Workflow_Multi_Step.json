If the image appears to be a screenshot of a website or desktop application, describe not only the contents of the programs but also the general layout and UX. If it is a photo or artwork, please describe in detail the contents and any styling that can be identified. If it is a screenshot of a game that has menu options or a HUD or any sort of interactive UX, please be sure to summarize not only what is currently occurring in the screenshot but also what options appear to be available in the various UI elements. Spare no detail and be as verbose as possible about every possible detail.\nSecond: Please describe any text that exists in the image, as accurately and completely as possible.",
