The conversation is occurring in a chat program similar to Discord.\nThe instructions for the conversation can be found below:\n[\n{chat_system_prompt}\n]\nAdditionally, a summary of the full chat can be found below:\n[\n[CHAT_SUMMARY]\n]\nSince that summary was last written, more messages have come in, which have been summarized into 'memory' chunks, which can be found below:\n[\n[LATEST_MEMORIES]\n]\nPlease consider the instructions, the entire summary of the chat up to now, and the new 'memories' that have been created since the summary was written.\nWhile maintaining as much of the original summary as possible (if one exists), please update the summary to include the new 'memories' that have been created. If it is necessary to drop some of the information in the current summary to fit within the token response constraints, then please prioritize the most important details that would be needed for the AI to effectively respond to the user if it only had this summary to work with for past information.\nPlease respond with the complete and updated summary. The response to this request will overwrite the previous summary.",
