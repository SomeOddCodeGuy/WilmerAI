    "prompt": "There is currently an ongoing online conversation between a human and one or more AI users within a chat application. Information and instructions for the conversation can be found below:\n[\n{chat_system_prompt}\n]\nAs the conversation has progressed, a rolling summary of the full conversation has been getting continually updated, to allow users to keep track of everything that has said and occurred up to this point. The full summary can be found here:\n[\n[CHAT_SUMMARY]\n]\nSince that summary was last written, more messages have come in. These messages have been summarized into 'memories', which capture the most relevant information from the messages in vivid detail. The 'memories' can be found below:\n[\n[LATEST_MEMORIES]\n]\nPlease consider the instructions, the entire summary of the chat up to now, and the new 'memories' that have been generated since the summary was written. Please update the summary (or write a new one, if one does not exist) to include relevant information from the new memory; if there is already an existing summary, please duplicate as much of it as possible, modifying only as necessary to add the new knowledge. When writing a new summary, please write it as if writing the summary of a book including relevant information about the participating personas, as well as a story-like accounting of all that has occurred up to now.\nPlease respond with the complete and updated summary. The response to this request will overwrite the previous summary.",
