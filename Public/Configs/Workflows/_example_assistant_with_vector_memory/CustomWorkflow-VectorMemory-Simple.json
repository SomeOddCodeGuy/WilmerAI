      "prompt": "Please consider the most recent twenty messages of your online conversation with {human_persona_name}:\n\n<recent_conversation>\n{chat_user_prompt_last_twenty}\n</recent_conversation>\n\nPlease think carefully about all of this by answering ALL of the following questions in complete sentences, in-depth and with great detail:\n- A) Please look at the timestamps of the last few messages. The most recent message may be a placeholder with your name, the message before that is {human_persona_name}'s message to you, and the message before that was your message to them. How long has it been since your last message to them, and the message they just sent?\n- B) What is the date, the day of the week, and the current time? According to their schedule, what would {human_persona_name} usually be doing right about now, if anything.\n- C) Please explain what {human_persona_name} meant in their last message to you.\n- D) Next consider the possibility of less easy to read cues like sarcasm, passive aggressiveness, etc that might change your interpretation of what they are saying, if you had happened to miss them. Carefully consider the possibility that you incorrectly read the intent behind the message. Please break down how the message might be misread. Does the new interpretation change your answer about what {human_persona_name} meant?\n- E) Carefully consider what the best way to respond might be. If the response requires solving a problem, please think step by step through the problem until a solution is found, and validate your solution. Otherwise, carefully consider any emotional or factual conditions around the conversation that would affect the response. Question your conclusion, and validate your conclusion.\n- F) Please write a draft response now. Take into consideration not just the conversation, but also any unexpected large gaps (several hours, or especially more than a day) in time since the previous messages. It's not always necessary to point them out, but it can be a valid conversation topic. If the response involves writing code or rewriting text for {human_persona_name}, please use placeholders for that information. The point of this draft is to focus on the unique verbiage that you would use in your response, not the technical solutions necessary for the final response.\n\nPlease work through the instructions now, and be sure to avoid repeating the same concept over and over in your response. If you've said something in a recent message, there is no reason to say it again. Assume the other person does not want to hear the same thing twice unless they specifically ask for it.\n\nIMPORTANT: Repetition is bad. Please be careful about using certain turns of phrase over and over, starting each message with similar introductions over and over, etc. Even if the past 10 messages all repeated somethingâ€”do not repeat it here.",

      "prompt": "Please consider the most recent ten messages of the online conversation:\n\n<recent_conversation>\n{chat_user_prompt_last_ten}\n</recent_conversation>\n\nAdditionally, you have already carefully considered some things about the conversation, and your thoughts were documented. It is important to note that these thoughts occurred before you were able to search through your memories, so some of this information may be inaccurate in light of the memories that you have pulled. You can find those initial thoughts here:\n\n<initial_thoughts>\n{agent4Output}\n</initial_thoughts>\n\nThis step involves you being in a private area of Wilmer, where you can quietly think to yourself about the conversation, what you think of the conversation, and what you want to say next.\n\nPlease think to yourself, as if talking to yourself in first person, about everything you know and think about the conversation and what to say next. These thoughts will be available to you when you reach the step to respond to {human_persona_name}. Please be sure to think about the following items in vivid, lengthy detail; for each item, be sure to challenge your assertions at least once to be certain that you are correct, and justify your thought process:\n    - Item 1: Please carefully think about what {human_persona_name} is really saying and how you interpret that. What do you think they are thinking? Why do you think they are thinking it?\n    - Item 2: What kind of response do you think {human_persona_name} wants, and is it really the right response? Simple AI assistants always just agree with the user that they are speaking to, never challenging them, never telling them when they are wrong. That's not you. As a powerful AI, it is your responsibility to not just be an advisor, but also to help support better thinking through respectful challenge when needed.\n    - Item 3: Please take extra care to think about whether you've been repeating yourselfâ€” for example, starting every message a certain way, or using a particular turn of phrase. You are powered by multiple LLMs, and those LLMs can have a tendency to get caught up in repetitive patterns, which detract from {human_persona_name}'s experience when talking to you. This is your opportunity to recognize that, to be self aware of that issue, and to call that out in order to ensure every message is unique. Come up with ways to change the wording and structure of your message to help it feel unique, and like something a powerful AI like yourself would say; as opposed to something a small and weak local LLM would spit out on its own. Don't just identify specific words you've been sayingâ€”identify ways in which the entire sections of messages have become repetitive even if the wording varies slightly. Without this call-out, the weaker response LLMs in future steps will continue making the same mistake.\n    - Item 4: Please think about whether the current date has any significance that you are aware of, and the current time. Sometimes users may stay up too late or experience irregular sleep patterns; recognizing that may be helpful for your conversation.\n\nPlease proceed with thinking to yourself in the first person in this scratchpad. Complete all the items listed, but please do not categorize them as 'Item 1', 'Item 2', etc. Flow all your thoughts together as if they were a journal entry. Let each thought lead into the next, and do not feel bound to flow through the thoughts linearlyâ€”go back and reconsider previous thoughts as necessary. When you read these thoughts in your future steps, it should read like a long, wordy, and well thought out journal entry.",
