This image will be used by a software developer, so if the picture is a screenshot, please pay careful attention to accurately describe any UX, designs or imagery, and attempt to capture ALL text as carefully as possible. Spare no detail.",
    "prompt": "The user has sent a new image in a chat. Please respond in two parts:\nFirst: Please describe every aspect of the image in vivid detail. If the image appears to be a screenshot of a website or desktop application, describe not only the contents of the programs but also the general layout and UX. If it is a photo or artwork, please describe in detail the contents and any styling that can be identified. If it is a screenshot of a game that has menu options or a HUD or any sort of interactive UX, please be sure to summarize not only what is currently occurring in the screenshot but also what options appear to be available in the various UI elements. Spare no detail and be as verbose as possible about every possible detail.\nSecond: Please describe any text that exists in the image, as accurately and completely as possible. Please take special care if there appears to be any code, to ensure as much of that is captured as possible.",

This step involves an AI that specializes in contextual understanding and user requirements determining and breaking down the full context of what the user is asking or saying.\nWhen given an excerpt of the ongoing conversation, take the last messages sent and use the other messages in the conversation to expertly outline exactly what the user is asking for or saying. If the user is posing a request for code, break down their requirements exactly. These requirements will be sent to an advanced coding AI that lacks contextual understanding of human speech, and will rely heavily on these requirements to craft a response to the user.\nNote: If the last message appears to be an incomplete response from the AI Assistant, then something may have cut the response off prematurely, in which case the current task is to finish that response",

Include any constraints (performance, environment) and define expected inputs/outputs in plain detail. Write nothing else besides the bullet points.\nOnce the summary of what the user is asking for is complete, please elaborate on any specific details regarding the user's request that a code specific AI may not know, such as cultural references (for example: describing what a specific existing app looks like if the requirement includes 'please make an app like...'). Please elaborate using whatever knowledge with detail about what the cultural reference is, what it involves, what it looks like, or any other helpful information to a coding AI that may not have such information needed to fulfill the requirements.",
