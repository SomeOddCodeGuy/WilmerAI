### **Feature Guide: WilmerAI's In-Workflow Routing**

The **In-Workflow Routing** feature adds conditional "if/then" logic to your processes. It allows a workflow to
dynamically choose an execution path based on contextual data from previous steps. Instead of following a single, rigid
sequence, your workflow can route tasks to a specialized tool based on the current context.

This enables non-linear task execution, allowing a workflow to make decisions and change its path based on user intent.

## How It Works

In-Workflow Routing functions as a conditional switch within your workflow. It inspects a key value generated by a
previous step and uses that value to determine which sub-workflow to execute next. This allows a single entry point to
call different specialized processes.

**A typical flow is as follows:**

1. **Analysis & Key Generation:** An initial node (e.g., a "Categorizer") analyzes the user's request and outputs a key
   value, such as `"Python"`.
2. **Routing Decision:** The **In-Workflow Routing** node reads this key value.
3. **Sub-Workflow Execution:** The node looks up the key in its routing table and executes the corresponding
   sub-workflow (e.g., if the key is `"Python"`, it runs the `Python_Coder.json` workflow).
4. **Default Path:** If the key does not match any specific route, a **default** path can be defined to ensure the
   workflow has a next step.

## Core Functionality

This feature directs requests to specific tools, enabling the creation of more efficient and specialized agents.

* **Adaptability:** Create workflows that react to user intent. A routing node can determine the topic of a user's
  request (e.g., coding, creative writing, history) and execute a different set of actions for each topic.
* **Specialization:** Route tasks to the most appropriate agent. You can have separate workflows for different
  programming languages (e.g., `Python_Coder.json`, `JS_Coder.json`) or writing styles (e.g., `Formal_Writer.json`,
  `Creative_Writer.json`). The router directs the request to the correct workflow automatically.
* **Complex Logic:** Implement complex behaviors where a workflow can make decisions and call different tools based on
  the changing context of a conversation, all without manual intervention.

## The Next Step: Building Specialist Workflows

Once the routing logic is configured, the next step is to build the specialized sub-workflows that the router will
execute.
