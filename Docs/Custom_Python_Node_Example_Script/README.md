## Custom Python Node Example Script

Wilmer has a [workflow](../User_Documentation/Setup/Workflow_Details/Workflows.md) node that allows the [running of
custom python scripts](../User_Documentation/Setup/Workflow_Details/Nodes/PythonModule.md). Inside this folder, you
can find an example of the structure of that python script. Simply use this template as the entry for the script,
and you can do whatever you need from there.
